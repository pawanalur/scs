## NEXT STEPS

- First, I should re-organize my src folder into: Authentication, Layout, MainBar, each with it's own views and components folder.
- Second, I should refactor navigation so that it occupies less of App.jsx
- Then, I should refactor my design document to include: A generic Action Layout, Eat/Exercise/Sleep being imported into this layout, and a small popup to calculate calories using AI.
- The next step is to build the generic action layout in the "In Progress" screen.
